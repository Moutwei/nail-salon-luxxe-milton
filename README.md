# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# Project Documentation

## Technologies Used

### React
React is used to build the user interface of the application. It allows us to create reusable components that manage their own state, which can be combined to build a complex UI.

### Vite
Vite is the build tool used to serve and bundle the React application. It offers fast development server start times and quick hot module replacement, improving the development workflow.

### Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is used for styling the application. Its utility-first approach allows for rapid and customizable design without writing custom CSS. Tailwind is integrated into the Vite build process.

### AOS (Animate On Scroll)
AOS is used to add animations to elements as they scroll into view. This enhances the user experience by providing visual feedback and engaging effects as users navigate the site.

## How They Work Together

- **React** components are styled using **Tailwind CSS** utility classes for layout and design.
- **Vite** handles the development server and build process for the **React** application, including processing **Tailwind CSS**.
- **AOS** animations are initialized and applied to **React** components, triggered as users scroll through the application.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install react react-dom tailwindcss aos
